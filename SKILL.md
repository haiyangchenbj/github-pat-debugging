# github-pat-debugging

## When to use
- A GitHub API or Contents API request returns `401 Bad credentials`.
- A token is shown as active or non-expiring in GitHub, or another GitHub workflow has just succeeded.
- Different runtimes or shells are being mixed, especially Bash, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, curl, or Git.

## Steps
1. Do not conclude that the token is expired or revoked from one failed request. Record the exact endpoint, HTTP status, auth scheme, and runtime.
2. Inspect the token file without printing the token: byte count, prefix, suffix, and trailing newline. Do not expose the full secret.
3. Test the same token with an independent client. In Bash, use direct expansion for curl:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(cat "$HOME/.workbuddy/connectors/default/tokens/github.txt")
   curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null \\
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \\
     -H "User-Agent: workbuddy-probe" \\
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \\
     https://api.github.com/user
   ```
4. When handing the token to a child process, export it explicitly. This is a critical Bash distinction:
   - Wrong for a later command: `TOKEN=$(cat file) && node script.js` (shell variable is not exported).
   - Correct: `export TOKEN="$(cat file)" && node script.js`.
   - Also correct for one process: `TOKEN="$(cat file)" node script.js`.
5. In Node.js, check `process.env.TOKEN` only as a boolean/presence signal; never print the value. Test both `Bearer` and `token` schemes if needed.
6. Compare the results. If curl is `200` with `X-OAuth-Scopes` and Node is `401`, inspect environment propagation before token state, proxy, or GitHub account hypotheses.
7. Only after independent clients using the same secret both fail, investigate GitHub-side causes: manual deletion/revocation, secret-scanning revocation, third-party credential revocation, OAuth-app token limits, organization/enterprise policy, or expiration. GitHub documents `oauth_authorization.destroy` as a possible security-log event.
8. Distinguish **repo-existence 404 from auth 404**. A private repo returns 404 (not 403) to unauthenticated or unauthorized viewers — web pages, raw file URLs, and unauthenticated API calls all show 404. This is GitHub's standard privacy behavior, NOT evidence the repo was deleted. To confirm existence: authenticated `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` — HTTP 200 with `private: true` means the repo exists and the 404s are permission-based hiding. Cross-validate: authenticated API 200 + unauthenticated raw 404 = private repo working as designed.
9. After fixing the auth path, fetch the current remote blob SHA, update through the Contents API with the SHA, and verify the raw file contains the intended content.

## Pitfalls
- `VAR=value command` exports the variable only to that command; `VAR=value && command` does not export it to the later command.
- A `401` from Node with `process.env.TOKEN` unset is a local process bug, not evidence of a revoked PAT.
- `Never used` or a stale "last used" label is weaker evidence than a live authenticated `GET /user`; use the latter for runtime validation.
- Do not print, commit, or paste a full PAT. If a token has been exposed, rotate it after completing the needed deployment.
- Do not overwrite a remote file without first retrieving its current SHA.
- A 404 on a private repo's web page or raw URL (unauthenticated) is privacy hiding, not deletion. Check with an authenticated API call before concluding the repo is gone.

## Verification
- Run an authenticated `GET /user` with the corrected runtime and confirm HTTP 200 plus the expected login, without printing the token.
- Confirm the write response is HTTP 200/201 and record only the commit SHA.
- Read the public raw file and verify the new marker is present and stale markers are absent.
- Record the precise root cause and command correction in the project daily log.
